Additions in the project:

Game Speed: I thought that the game was pretty slow which made it a bit boring, so i changed the following: increased hay machine speed, increased hay speed, reduced the delay when deleting sheeps.

Sound: I followed the part2 of the exercises to add sound effects and also added background music on my own.

Interface: When playing there are two UI elements the first is a Score counter that changes depending on the number of dropped and saved sheep, the second one has a heart icon and is counter for the sheep you saved.

Others: When playing you can press esc you return to a main menu.
